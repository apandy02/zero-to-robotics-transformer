# Zero to Robotics Transformer
This repository is designed to guide you through understanding and implementing transformers in the context of robot path planning. It includes seminal papers, helpful links, and practical code examples/notebooks to facilitate learning.

## Prerequisites

This resource assumes familiarity with the following topics:
- **Deep Neural Networks:** Understanding of basic neural network architectures and backpropagation.
- **Robot Path Planning:** Basic concepts and problem formulation in robot path planning.
- **Reinforcement Learning (Nice to have):** A foundational understanding of RL problem formulations.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/aryamanpandya99/transformers-path-planning.git
```

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:
- **Papers**: A selection of important papers that have shaped the use of transformers in robot path planning.
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides and notebooks demonstrating the implementation and theory.
- **External Resources**: Links to additional resources for deeper understanding and further reading.

### Papers
